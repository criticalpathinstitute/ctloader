      Background and study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are carrying out a clinical trial of two different sealant materials to&#xD;
      compare the retentivity and decay inhibiting properties of the above said materials. it is a&#xD;
      split mouth study, wherein the 2 sealant materials will be placed on the exactly opposite&#xD;
      placed molars of 180 healthy school children in the age group between 7 - 10 yrs of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      who can participate? school children in the age group between 7 - 10 yrs of age with non&#xD;
      decayed contra lateral permanent 1st molars at a school in the southern part of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      what does the study involve? over a period of 18 months, the retentivity and the decay&#xD;
      preventing effects of these two sealant materials( RESIN BASED SEALANTS AND ART SEALANTS)&#xD;
      will be clinically assessed by us.&#xD;
&#xD;
      possible benefits/ risks of participating in the trial the participants will be not be&#xD;
      exposed to any kind of risks as it is a non invasive procedure the possible benefits may be&#xD;
      preventing decay to the permanent molar in the long run&#xD;
&#xD;
      study start date/duration of the study? MARCH 2015 is the month wherein the sealant&#xD;
      applications have started and expected to last till the April of 2017&#xD;
&#xD;
      funding? self funded study&#xD;

      Pits and fissures in the first molars are the most susceptible sites for dental caries in the&#xD;
      permanent dentition and contemporary studies show specifically that 85% or more of the caries&#xD;
      is nested in the above-mentioned sites . Thus, prevention of caries in these tooth sites is&#xD;
      of crucial importance in keeping a sound permanent dentition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sealing the pits and fissures of molars and premolars for prevention of dental caries was&#xD;
      first introduced in the 1960s . It is now accepted as a highly effective method in preventing&#xD;
      dental caries .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prominantly, there are basically two types of sealant materials..i.e resin based sealants&#xD;
      which are flowable composite resins and Glass inomer based sealants. Reading through the&#xD;
      literature, it is well understood that the resin based sealants are more retentive than the&#xD;
      GIC based sealants mainly because the enamel surface is etched prior to the placement and it&#xD;
      is dispensed through syringes, thereby it generally adapts well to the surfaces. GIC sealants&#xD;
      are known to be equally effective when to comes to caries prevention, but generally are far&#xD;
      less retentive than the resin based sealants. the main issue regarding the placement of resin&#xD;
      based sealants is that it is a cumbersome procedure requiring strict isolation. Looking at a&#xD;
      dental public health point of view, especially in a country like India, the use of resin&#xD;
      based sealants at outreach centres will be a problem because of the lack of adequate&#xD;
      infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To counter the limited applicability of resin based sealants in a field setting, the use of a&#xD;
      high viscosity GIC sealant is advocated here. The high viscosity GIC sealant has a better&#xD;
      compressive strength to take on the occulsal stress and thereby it is expected that the&#xD;
      retention of the ART sealant (High viscous GIC sealant) using the ART technique (finger press&#xD;
      technique) would be better than the conventional GIC based sealants. Till date, a very&#xD;
      limited number of studies have been performed on the comparison between the ART sealant and&#xD;
      the resin based sealant( gold standard) and thereby, this study has been conceived to assess&#xD;
      the retentivity and the caries preventive effect of the above two systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis states that there is no expected difference between resin based sealants&#xD;
      and ART sealants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the statistical analysis, the sample size for this study has been estimated to be&#xD;
      180 subjects. ethical clearance has been obtained from the IRB of the dental school and&#xD;
      informed consent obtained from all the participating subjects. This is a spilt mouth study,&#xD;
      wherein on side, resin based sealants are placed and on the other side, the ART sealants are&#xD;
      placed. All the participating 180 subjects do have a caries free permanent lower 1st right&#xD;
      and left molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sealants are placed according to the manufacturer s instructions. after placements, the&#xD;
      retention and the caries preventive effects are followed up progressively for a period of 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
